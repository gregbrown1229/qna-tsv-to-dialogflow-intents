Does the money go to the child?	When you sponsor a child, you pay $33 each month. This money doesn't go directly to the child or family. Instead, it's pooled with the monthly donations from other sponsors in the child's community. Then, local partners use it for programs or services that community needs most, like clean water, vaccinations or teacher training. That way, your money benefits the most children possible!	new.tsv

Why wasn't I notified that my child moved?	I'm so sorry that we did not fully meet your expectations as a sponsor. We do send a letter to notify you if your child moved, and I hope you were able to read through that letter. We'll do our best to explain. When a family decides to relocate outside of ChildFund program areas, they usually don't give much notice, which means we often aren't able to let the sponsor know about the situation before the child moves. I understand having to say goodbye to a child is one of the hardest things we have to ask our sponsors to do, especially under these circumstances, so we try to include as much information as possible about the child's departure in your letter. We appreciate your commitment to your sponsored child, and we believe you created a meaningful bond which will continue to inspire both of you in your lives. If you'd like to send a farewell letter, we will do our best to get it to your sponsored child if some of their family is still in the area. Thank you so much for your sponsorship, and I hope you'll consider helping another child.	new.tsv	
Why wasn't I notified my child's community got shut down?	We understand your concern, and we're sorry you didn't receive the letter that was mailed to all the sponsors who were impacted!

We're so happy the community is now self sustaining, but we also understand that the end of a sponsorship is hard for both children and sponsors. You can get in touch with a ChildFund team member here and they will get back to you soon with more information.	new.tsv

Why haven't I received any letters yet?	Waiting is always the hardest part, right? We get it!

tell me about sponsorship	When you become a ChildFund sponsor, you help a child connect with resources and opportunities they need and deserve. Your sponsorship helps protect children's rights to education, food, healthcare, and other necessities. And when kids are better off, they make their families and communities stronger too. You can learn more about the impact you can make through sponsorship [here](http://bit.ly/2lxeEO7).	new.tsv	
What are the benefits of sponsorship?	There are a lot of benefits of sponsorship, but I'll try to keep it short! Your sponsored child will benefit from having access to programs that help her or him grow up safe, healthy and educated. As a sponsor, you'll receive ongoing correspondence from your sponsored child in the form of a letter. At ChildFund, helping other people makes us feel happy and fulfilled, and we think's a huge benefit for our sponsors, too! You and your sponsored child will benefit from the connection and relationship you'll have the chance to create an experience that can be rewarding and life changing for you both. Learn more about sponsorship [here](http://bit.ly/2lxeEO7).	new.tsv	
What tangible benefits does my child receive through sponsorship?	Good question! We collaborate with local organizations in all the communities where we work to find out what specific services people living there need. Usually, these services include projects that promote access to health care, safe water, nutrition, education and training programs. Since I don't know your sponsored child, I can't give you exact details, but you'll learn the specifics of our work in your sponsored child's community through annual progress reports and direct communication from the child!	new.tsv	
What is the difference between sponsorship funds and direct gifts to my child?	Good question! Sponsorship funds go to local partner organizations in the communities where we work, so that money goes toward the specific needs of your sponsored child's community, like helping to build a school or upgrading a water source that your sponsored child uses every day. A direct gift gets changed into the right currency and then goes to the child and his or her family to use, so families might buy shoes for their child, food or household furniture or anything they may need at the time!	new.tsv	
How long does my sponsorship last?	Your sponsorship lasts as long as you keep up your monthly giving and the child stays in our programs and in a community where we work. Most children graduate from our programs between the ages of 18 and 24, depending on whether or not they stay in our programs or continue their education. If a child moves away from his local community, gets married or stops participating in our programs, we may have to prematurely end the child's enrollment.	new.tsv	
What is child sponsorship?	That's an important question, and I'm glad you asked. When you become a ChildFund sponsor, you help fight poverty by giving a child a chance at a life they deserve. When children have access to better opportunities, they make their families and communities stronger, too. Through our local partners and with the help of parents, teachers and local governments, your sponsorship helps protect children's rights to education, food, clean water, health care and other necessities. Sponsorship is a relationship, a connection, a way to be a global citizen. We love it, and we think you will, too.	new.tsv

How does ChildFund work?	Good question! Right now, 570 million children are living in extreme poverty. That means their families can't always afford basic needs like food and water, or basic rights like health care and education. Because of their circumstances, these children are also more vulnerable to child protection issues like violence, child labor, and child marriage. We work with local partner organizations, focusing on the specific developmental and protection needs of children at each stage of life. And we make sure our programs and services are tailored to address the unique needs of each community, helping to create positive long term change and opportunities for children to break free from the cycle of poverty and lead fulfilling lives, as we all deserve. Please take a look at our [website](https://www.childfund.org) to learn more details about our work.	new.tsv

My  child 's community got shut down and I wasn't notified.	We understand your concern. Our goal is to help the local partner organizations through which we work in communities to become self sufficient, which is what has happened in your child's community, thanks to your continued support.

Please give them a call at 1.800.776.6767, or email them at questions@childfund.org. Again, we're so grateful for your support.	Editorial
