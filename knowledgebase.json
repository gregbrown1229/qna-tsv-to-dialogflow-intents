		"speech": "Good question! Sponsorship funds go to local partner organizations in the communities where we work, so that money goes toward the specific needs of your sponsored childs community, like helping to build a school or upgrading a water source that your sponsored child uses every day. A direct gift gets changed into the right currency and then goes to the child and his or her family to use, so families might buy shoes for their child, food or household furniture or anything they may need at the time!"

	{
		"text": "How long does my sponsorship last?",
		"speech": "Your sponsorship lasts as long as you keep up your monthly giving and the child stays in our programs and in a community where we work. Most children graduate from our programs between the ages of 18 and 24, depending on whether or not they stay in our programs or continue their education. If a child moves away from his local community, gets married or stops participating in our programs, we may have to prematurely end the childs enrollment."

		"speech": "Thats an important question, and Im glad you asked. When you become a ChildFund sponsor, you help fight poverty by giving a child a chance at a life they deserve. When children have access to better opportunities, they make their families and communities stronger, too. Through our local partners and with the help of parents, teachers and local governments, your sponsorship helps protect childrens rights to education, food, clean water, health care and other necessities. Sponsorship is a relationship, a connection, a way to be a global citizen. We love it, and we think you will, too."

That means their families cant always afford basic needs like food and water, or basic rights like health care and education. Because of their circumstances, these children are also more vulnerable to child protection issues like violence, child labor, and child marriage. We work with local partner organizations, focusing on the specific developmental and protection needs of children at each stage of life. And we make sure our programs and services are tailored to address the unique needs of each community, helping to create positive long term change and opportunities for children to break free from the cycle of poverty and lead fulfilling lives, as we all deserve.
